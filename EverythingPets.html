                I firstly came up with what if scenarios by considering and imagining myself in the users shoes, to understand the problems they already face or might in the future to better understand their pain points and touch points to develop a product vision and solution by further creating user personas,
                empathy and journey map.
            </p>
            <p>
                I conducted a few user interviews and brain storming sessions with my family members and friends who have one or multiple pets and came up with what if scenarios beforehand for my questionnaires to probe them, and for a better understanding of their touch points.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following was revealed:

                10 highest rated other available offerings in the market were studied and it was found that there is no such produt in the market with such holistic solutions for pet care applications advocating and in affiliation with animal welfare.
                However, the research sheded light over the current user feedbacks and other obstacles or even the primary goal of the user for using the application.The findings were futher implemented during ideaion and design phase.

                    <br>• To enable user to reach out for help during emergencies by integrating a network of local NGO’s and individuals/ professionals as volunteers.

        Although, with almost complete sitemap architecture for all the features & services drafted, 100+ wireframes later,
        a MVP prototype was developed and successfully tested it, documenting findings and observations. 
        Also discussed the other features mentioned on the Homescreen as the product offerings were quite substantial, 
        and needed validating from users point of view so as to prioritise the features further.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Following are a few higlidhted findings from the research:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="nextSteps">
                The intial MVP offering appealed to the users and they showed keen interest in using it.
            </li>
            <li class="nextSteps">
                A few concerns were raised for the visual design colours and causing a few accessibility reports.
            </li>
            <li class="nextSteps">
                Users often asked about scheduling medicine reminders and showed curiosity of knowing about using the feature.
            </li>
            <li class="nextSteps">
                Users had a very positive outlook towards the product and other features to be offered looking at the Homescreen.
            </li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                A broad generic approach was taken for the overall judiciary proccedings and can further be iterised based on various judicial hierarchy and various other category specific courtrooms.
            </li>
            <li>
                The finndings of the final Hi-Fi testing could be implemented and tested with a bigger user pool both for Lawyers and general population.
            </li>
            <li>
                The solution was designed considering the bigger user group i.e the general population and hennce the solution was designed as a android native mobile experience considering  the dominating user base in the country. ANd further designs could be integrated for the core user i.e the judicial members.

            </li>
            <li>
                The designs were mainly tested with lawyers as representative for the judicial members. More core judicial members representing government bureaucrats and their fuctionality need to be interviewed and inplemented in design iterations.            </li>
        </ul>
