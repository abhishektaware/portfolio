                The pet care space lacks a unified, reliable solution that
                connects pet owners with a broad network of services — including
                vets, groomers, boarders, walkers, sitters, NGOs, and community
                resources. Existing platforms are often fragmented and fail to
                deliver a seamless, pet-centric experience.
              </p>
              <p class="flexPara">
                This project aimed to design a comprehensive pet care app that
                brings together essential services, professionals, and advocacy
                groups into a single, user-friendly ecosystem. With a focus on
                functionality, feasibility, and usability, the goal was to
                create a solution that supports both pet and stray care while
                fostering community awareness and engagement.

              <p>
                To anchor the design in real user needs, I created a detailed
                persona representing the core behaviors, goals, and pain points
                of a typical pet owner. This persona helped humanize the user,
                allowing me to stay focused on their perspective throughout the
                process. It was based on insights gathered from generative
                research, highlighting both functional expectations and
                emotional drivers behind pet care decisions.

                The empathy map allowed me to go deeper into the user’s mindset
                by visualizing what they say, think, feel, and do. This tool
                helped uncover unspoken frustrations and needs—especially around
                trust, accessibility of services, and care for strays. It played
                a key role in informing more empathetic design decisions by
                surfacing user motivations and pain points that personas alone
                couldn't capture.

                Mapping the user’s journey across various scenarios revealed
                critical moments where users struggle—like searching for
                reliable service providers, handling emergencies, or caring for

                and illuminated opportunities for meaningful intervention

                insights and design planning.

                I converted the key user pain points into “How Might We”
                questions to reframe challenges into opportunities. These
                questions sparked focused ideation and helped align design goals
                with user and business value. They ranged from “How might we
                simplify access to trusted pet care services?” to “How might we
                assist pet or stray emergencies?”

                The app sets out to be a holistic pet care platform that
                empowers pet owners with everything they need — from discovering
                pet-friendly places and professionals to adopting, rescuing,
                volunteering, and even socializing their pets. It aims to build
                a vibrant ecosystem where pet parents can manage their furry
                friends' lives end-to-end: schedule activities, attend events,
                shop for essentials, monitor pets’ well-being, and connect with
                a wider pet-loving community. The long-term vision clearly goes
                beyond just utility — it’s about creating a connected,
                supportive, and joyful lifestyle for pets and their people.

                The MVP is intentionally lean, focusing on validating the core
                idea and establishing essential functionality. It includes user
                onboarding and authentication, along with two foundational
                modules: My Pets — where users can manage pet profiles, and
                Schedule — to help plan pet-related tasks and activities. These
                core features lay the groundwork for user engagement,
                habit-building, and future scalability, without overwhelming
                users right out of the gate.

                I conducted usability testing with five users to evaluate the
                design prototype, documenting pain points and areas of
                confusion. Though the design wasn’t iterated post-testing,
                compiling actionable feedback and proposing improvements
                enhanced my ability to interpret user behavior objectively and
                present clear recommendations that future design cycles can
                build on.
